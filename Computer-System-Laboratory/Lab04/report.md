# LAB4 Catalpult Report

## What We've learned in this lab
1. How to draw a 3D model using fusion360
    - After trial and error, we can now design a simple 3D model by ourselves.
    - Other than the content learned in slide, We've learned some extra cool features such as loft by ourselves.

2. How to design a trigger
    - we never design a catapult without any other tools which include rubber band and spring. Therefore, we have to design our trigger and make the device storage the energy.


## How you can improve the device and tell us what you did
1. We do the bowl to place the ball. In that case, our catapult won't block the motion of ball.
2. we cut a lot of base off. Therefore, The device will need fewer PLA.
3. We make the left side and right side of the arm thicker. Therefore, the device will be harder to break and have stronger elasticity. 

## Some feedback for this lab

1. It is hard to master fusion360 in such a short time, making it a tough challenge to finish the lab.
2. We only have one chance to test our work, which make us unsure with whether our work will work, it would be better if we have more chances.
3. We suggest that the lab demo be a related to the work, it would be better if TA demo a simpler catapult that give us direction we can go on.

## Anything related to this lab
- Professor and TA is so handsome.
