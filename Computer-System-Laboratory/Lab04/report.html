<h2 id="what-weve-learned-in-this-lab">What We've learned in this lab</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How to draw a 3D model using fusion360</p>
<ul>
<li>After trial and error, we can now design a simple 3D model by ourselves.</li>
<li>Other than the content learned in slide, We've learned some extra cool features such as loft by ourselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to design a trigger</p>
<ul>
<li>we never design a catapult without any other tools which include rubber band and spring. Therefore, we have to design our trigger and make the device storage the energy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-you-can-improve-the-device-and-tell-us-what-you-did">How you can improve the device and tell us what you did</h2>
<ol>
<li>We do the bowl to place the ball. In that case, our catapult won't block the motion of ball.</li>
<li>we cut a lot of base off. Therefore, The device will need fewer PLA.</li>
<li>We make the left side and right side of the arm thicker. Therefore, the device will be harder to break and have stronger elasticity.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="some-feedback-for-this-lab">Some feedback for this lab</h2>
<ol>
<li>It is hard to master fusion360 in such a short time, making it a tough challenge to finish the lab.</li>
<li>We only have one chance to test our work, which make us unsure with whether our work will work, it would be better if we have more chances.</li>
<li>We suggest that the lab demo be a related to the work, it would be better if TA demo a simpler catapult that give us direction we can go on.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="anything-related-to-this-lab">Anything related to this lab</h2>
<ul>
<li>Professor and TA is so handsome.</li>
</ul>
